                <h2>Personal Information of PM</h2>
                <p>Imran Khan, in full Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi, (born October 5, 1952, Lahore, Pakistan), Pakistani
                    cricket player, politician, philanthropist, and prime minister of Pakistan (2018–22)
                    who became a national hero by leading Pakistan’s national team to a Cricket World Cup victory in
                    1992 and later entered politics as a critic of government corruption in Pakistan.

                    Early life and cricket career
                    Khan was born into an affluent Pashtun family in Lahore and was educated at elite schools in
                    Pakistan and the United Kingdom, including the Royal Grammar School in Worcester and Aitchison
                    College in Lahore.
                    There were several accomplished cricket players in his family, including two elder cousins, Javed
                    Burki and Majid Khan, who both served as captains of the Pakistani national team. Imran Khan played
                    cricket in Pakistan and the United Kingdom in his teens and continued playing while studying
                    philosophy, politics, and economics at the University of Oxford. Khan played his first match for
                    Pakistan’s national team in 1971, but he did not take a permanent place on the team until after his
                    graduation from Oxford in 1976.</p>
